# First timer's guide to editing PPUC documentation

Hey! You found something that is not documented yet, or that needs to be
updated. What a great opportunity to help us improve the documentation!

It can sound scary to contribute to the documentation, but it's pretty easy,
AND you can feel good that you're "giving back" to the PPUC project and the
larger pinball maker community.

Also, whenever you make a change and submit it, the maintainers of PPUC
will review it before it goes live. So you can't accidentally delete the
entire site or anything like that. :) Also, you'll have a chance to
continue to update and edit your changes before they go live. So there's
no reason to be afraid to contribute!

We have a whole guide to get you started: [How to contribute to PPUC Docs](help_docs.md).
