It is able to monitor all playfield switches, lights, and solenoids and to trigger and distribute corresponding events to attached sub-systems. It is possible to monitor DMD and sound commands, too.</p> <p>Sub-system like the built-in EffectController are able to drive additional LEDs, motors, and coils. Other sub-systems could be video players or audio systems. The additional effects are bundled per pinball machine in so-called Pinball Power-Ups (PPUs).</p> <p>For homebrew machines there will be additional software to act as \"CPU\", running the game logic aka rules and communicating with the controllers. The target is to use the VPX Standalone script engine and the VPX Standalone ecosytem.</p> <p>A special variation of that \"CPU\" is suitable as replacement for a broken CPU of an existing machine. That development started as part of the PinMAME project. Nowadays it is a standalone programm that leverages libpinmame: https://github.com/PPUC/ppuc</p> <p>As a sub-project ZeDMD has been created to emulate a real DMD for virtual pinball machines and to be used with as replacement in real machines.</p> <p>To get involved in the development or to discuss your PPUC project, join us on Discord.</p>"},{"location":"#motivation","title":"Motivation","text":"<p>We want to enable people to be creative and to modernize old pinball machines using today's technology.

The communication happens via a BUS and the protocol enhances the DOF protocol which is known from the virtual pinball world.</p> <p> </p> <p>In case of replacing a broken CPU and driver boards, the platform independent PPUC command line tool can run on any old or small computer like a Raspberry Pi and leverages libpinmame to emulate the ROM.</p> <p> Click the image to watch the video on YouTube.</p> <p>It you replace the entire electronics and wiring of an existing machine, a web-based configuration tool could be used to configure your setup.</p> <p>In case of a homebrew machine, the intention is that you design and devolep your pinball machine using VPX. Our plan is to create a special version of VPX Standalone (VPX for Linux, macOS, iOS, Android) to operate the machine.
